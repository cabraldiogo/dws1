			<h2>History</h2>
			<p> Rio de Janeiro commonly referred to
			simply as Rio,[2] is the capital city of the State of Rio de
			Janeiro, the second largest city of Brazil, and the third
			largest metropolitan area and agglomeration in South America,
			boasting approximately 6.3 million people within the city
			proper,[3][4] making it the 6th largest in the Americas, and
			26th in the world.[5] Part of the city has been designated as
			a World Heritage Site, named "Rio de Janeiro: Carioca
			Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea", identified by
			UNESCO on 1 July 2012 in the category Cultural Landscape.[6]
			</p>
			<p>
			Founded in 1565, by the Portuguese, the city was initially
			the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a captaincy of
			the Portuguese Empire. It later, in 1793, became the capital
			of the State of Brazil, a State of the Portuguese Empire. In
			1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from
			Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of
			the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in
			1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and
			future King João VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity
			of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil,
			and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental
			Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian
			Independence began. It subsequently served as the capital of
			the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889,
			and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960.

			Rio de Janeiro represents the second largest GDP in the country[7] (and 30th largest in the world in 2008),[8] estimated at about R$343 billion (IBGE/2008) (nearly US$201 billion), and is headquarters to two of Brazil's major companies—Petrobras and Vale, and major oil companies and telephony in Brazil, besides the largest conglomerate of media and communications companies in Latin America, the Globo Organizations. The home of many universities and institutes, it is the second largest center of research and development in Brazil, accounting for 17% of national scientific production—according to 2005 data.[9]
