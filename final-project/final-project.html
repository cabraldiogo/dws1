			<section> <p> Rio de Janeiro commonly referred to
		simply as Rio,[2] is the capital city of the State of Rio de
		Janeiro, the second largest city of Brazil, and the third
		largest metropolitan area and agglomeration in South America,
		boasting approximately 6.3 million people within the city
		proper,[3][4] making it the 6th largest in the Americas, and
		26th in the world.[5] Part of the city has been designated as
		a World Heritage Site, named "Rio de Janeiro: Carioca
		Landscapes between the Mountain and the Sea", identified by
		UNESCO on 1 July 2012 in the category Cultural Landscape.[6]
		Founded in 1565, by the Portuguese, the city was initially
		the seat of the Captaincy of Rio de Janeiro, a captaincy of
		the Portuguese Empire. It later, in 1793, became the capital
		of the State of Brazil, a State of the Portuguese Empire. In
		1808, when the Portuguese Royal Court transferred itself from
		Portugal to Brazil, Rio de Janeiro became the chosen seat of
		the court of Queen Maria I of Portugal, who subsequently, in
		1815, under the leadership of her son, the Prince Regent, and
		future King Jo√£o VI of Portugal, raised Brazil to the dignity
		of a kingdom, within the United Kingdom of Portugal, Brazil,
		and Algarves. Rio stayed the capital of the pluricontinental
		Lusitanian monarchy until 1822, when the War of Brazilian
		Independence began. It subsequently served as the capital of
		the independent monarchy, the Empire of Brazil, until 1889,
		and then the capital of a republican Brazil until 1960.
